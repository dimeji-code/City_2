# City2

Processing 3 group project.

My first ever Programming project completed with the help of Anders Sostenes (shout out to you for carrying the group as i was lost on certain concepts). 
A ruthless depiction of a city riddled with ops that have no time for talking, just shooting. Conquer the city by defeating your enemies.
